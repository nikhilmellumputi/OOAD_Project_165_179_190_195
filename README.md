# ***Event Management System***
# **Abstract**
     Various events take place in colleges and event management has always been a topic of concern. Maintaining registrations being a part of event management is always done manually. The data might not be organised properly Also, retrieving and updating registration details is difficult.Thus our project is to simplify this task and make it more efficient. It makes registration process automated. 
  
     The scope of the project is clear to give a simple and attractive application to simplify the work as well as to reduce the efforts while doing it manually or we can say by doing it with old methods. 
     
     In this application we are able to save database of all registrations made by the user. In this way we can keep track of records without human interference.Two kinds of people are able to use this application as user and the admin as well. The user is able to register for an event just a click away sitting at home and the admin is able to add or update/manage events accordingly.
